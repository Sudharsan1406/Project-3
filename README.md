## Domain 
    Urban Transportation Analytics & Predictive Modeling

## Problem Statement 
As a Data Analyst at an urban mobility analytics firm, my mission is to unlock insights 
from real-world taxi trip data to enhance fare estimation systems and promote pricing 
transparency for passengers. This project focuses on analyzing historical taxi trip 
records collected from a metropolitan transportation network. 

## Real-World Use Cases: 
  1. Ride-Hailing Services – Fare estimate before ride booking. 
  2. Driver Incentive Systems – Suggest optimal locations and times for higher 
  earnings. 
  3. Urban Mobility Analytics – Fare trends by time, location, and trip type. 
  4. Travel Budget Planners – Predict estimated trip fare for tourists. 
  5. Taxi Sharing Apps – Dynamic pricing for shared rides.

## Problem Type: 
  Supervised Machine Learning – Regression 
  Target Variable: total_amount
